                <div>
                    Creating Habits is fairly straight forward, you are given the option to identify
                    your habit with a name and description, the you must select its frequency. Daily
                    frequency will be which days you want the habit to occur on each week, weekly
                    frequency will be a day for the habit to occur each week and monthly frequency
                    which is for a specific day of the month. There are a couple other options as
                    well, such as colour and whether to start the habit next week. Note: Once you
                    create a habit, you cannot change its kind of frequency, but you can change
                    which days it occurs for daily, the day for weekly and day of the month (not in
                    the past) for monthly.

                <div>
                    At the start you will have no habits but as you create them they will be created
                    and scheduled for the rest of the month (Based on their frequency). Its not till
                    the start of next month that the habits you have setup, we will automatically
                    scheduled them for the month.

                <div>
                    There is an extra option when creating a habit and that is to set a specific
                    time frame on the habit, ie; for 4 weeks or 6 months. With this option set we
                    will automatically handle the scheduling on our end. Once that time frame has
                    ended the habit will become a standard habit and will be scheduled based on its
                    frequency. If you set a habit to not be a goal, you can always add one when
                    editing.
